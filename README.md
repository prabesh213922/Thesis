# Thesis
Inorder to run the models, all these files needs to be kept under the same folder and given proper 'path' to the folder in MATLAB. 
The file named 'CapabilityCurveVisiualization' is an MATLAB App which loads other two matlab script files named 'Kundur_CIGRE_based_collapse_04' and 'Rotor_temperature' which are included in the same folder.
'Thermal_model_scope' is a file which contains the thermal model built in Simulink. There is a interaction between this file and the matlab script 'ThermalModel_Thermal_model_scope' for the temperature visualization of the machine.
